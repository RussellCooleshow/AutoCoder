
# AutoCoder Project

This project is a part of the HyperSkill curriculum and focuses on implementing an autoencoder neural network for dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction.

## Project Description

AutoCoder is a Python-based project developed as a part of the HyperSkill curriculum. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in building and training autoencoder neural networks using TensorFlow. The autoencoder architecture is used for dimensionality reduction and reconstruction of data, making it a valuable tool in various domains such as image processing, natural language processing, and more.

## Features

- Implementation of an autoencoder neural network.
- Training the autoencoder model on a dataset.
- Evaluating the model's performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy.
- Experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
